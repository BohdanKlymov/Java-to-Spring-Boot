# Java-to-Spring-Boot

This repository documents my structured learning path in **Java backend development**, starting from Java fundamentals and progressing toward **Spring Boot and REST APIs**.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong foundations**, practice consistently, and gradually move toward **real-world backend projects**.

---

## Learning Goals

- Master Java fundamentals and object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Understand core Java libraries and collections
- Learn Gradle and proper project structure
- Build small and medium-sized Java projects
- Learn Spring Boot and REST API development
- Work with databases using Spring Data JPA
- Develop clean, readable, and maintainable code

---

## Learning Roadmap

The learning process is divided into clear phases:

### Phase 1: Java Fundamentals
- Java syntax and basics
- Control structures
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Collections Framework
- Exception handling
- File I/O
- Basic generics

### Phase 2: Build Tools
- Gradle basics
- Project structure
- Dependency management
- Running Java applications with Gradle

### Phase 3: Core Java Projects
- Console-based applications
- File handling projects
- Applying OOP principles in real scenarios

### Phase 4: Spring Boot
- Spring Framework fundamentals
- Dependency Injection
- REST API development
- Spring Data JPA
- Database integration (H2 / MySQL)
- Exception handling

---

##  Technologies Used

- Java
- Gradle
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 / MySQL
- IntelliJ IDEA

---

##  Learning Approach

- Consistent weekly schedule
- Practice-first mindset (more coding, less watching)
- Small exercises → projects
- Monthly self-tests to measure progress
- Clean code and proper structure over shortcuts

---

##  Status

**In Progress**

This repository will be updated continuously as my skills improve.

At a later stage, larger and more polished projects will be moved to **separate repositories**.
